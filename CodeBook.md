There are two sections in this document:\par
\tab\ul\b Section 1: Study Design\ulnone\b0    Briefly describes how \tab\tab the original research study was conducted\par
\tab\ul\b Section 2: Code Book\ulnone\b0    Describes the \tab variables in \tab the original dataset with an update indicating all \tab the variables and summaries calculated in the tidy \tab dataset.\par

\ul\b SECTION 1: STUDY DESIGN\par
\pard\nowidctlpar\lang1033\ulnone\b0\f1 The downloaded data is the "\ul Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0\ulnone " dataset.  Briefly, the researchers carried out experiments with a group of 30 volunteers aged 19 to 48.  "Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, (the researchers) captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz" (\i the quoted section \i0 was \i reproduced from the original README document in the downloaded dataset\i0 ).  \par
\tab The experimental data and associated means and standard deviation variables are located in the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files: each record is a 561-feature vector and the labels for these 561 variables is contained in the features.txt file. The train data was generated by selecting 70% of the volunteers to perform the experimental tasks; the test data was generated by selecting 30% of the volunteers to perform the experimental tasks.\par

2.1 \ul The variables in the original dataset \ulnone (x_train and x_test files)\par
\tab Th\lang1033 e analysis performed by the script included in this repository uses the "\ul Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0\ulnone " dataset.  The experimental variables in this dataset were collected using the accelerometer and gyroscope capabilities of a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) worn by the test subjects.\par
The complete list of 561 features is available in the feature.txt file. These variables include the following subsets:\par
- The accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw time domain signals (as denoted by the prefix "t"). These are the features \b tAcc-XYZ, tGyro-XYZ \b0 and associated single directional components (in -X, -Y, and -Z). These signals were captured at 50 Hz, then filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.\par
\pard - The \b tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ \b0 features were obtained from the acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. \par
\par
- Jerk signals \b tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ \b0 were obtained from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity by derivation in time.\par
\par
- \b tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag \b0 are the magnitude of the body linear acceleration and angular velocity calculated using the Euclidean norm.\par
\par
-\b fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag\b0  were obtained by applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals ("f" denotes frequency domain signals).\par
\par
In summary, the following variables were estimated from the signals as described above:\par
\par
\b tBodyAcc-XYZ\par
tGravityAcc-XYZ\par
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ\par
tBodyGyro-XYZ\par
