        1) "run_analysis.R"  -the script 
        2) "CodeBook.md"     -the codebook which describes the variables and providesinformation about the experimental data
        3) README.md         -this file

INFORMATION ABOUT THE R SCRIPT: "run.analysis.R"

	The script assumes that the original data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) has been downloaded and unzipped in the working directory.  

	The downloaded data is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, Version 1.0" dataset.  Briefly, the researchers carried out experiments with a group of 30 volunteers aged 19 to 48.  "Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, (the researchers) captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz" (the quoted section was reproduced from the original README document in the downloaded dataset).  
	The experimental data and associated means and standard deviation variables are located in the X_test.txt and X_train.txt files: each record is a 561-feature vector and the labels for these 561 variables is contained in the features.txt file. The train data was generated by selecting 70% of the volunteers to perform the experimental tasks; the test data was generated by selecting 30% of the volunteers to perform the experimental tasks.

	Unzipping the downloaded data creates a folder (or directory) called "UCI HAR Dataset" in the working directory.  The "UCI HAR Dataset" contains multiple files.  At the very least, the following files must be present in the "YourWorkingDirectory/UCI HAR Dataset" directory for the script to run:
		- features.txt
		- test/subject.txt
		- test/X_test.txt
		- test/y_test.txt
		- train/subject.txt
		- train/X_train.txt
		- train/y_train.txt

For convenience, the dplyr library is loaded by the script.


WHAT THE SCRIPT ACCOMPLISHES: 

The script "run_analysis.R" reads the above files in R and merges the data in the following manner:

	1) Variable labels from the features.txt file are used to create column names in the X_train and x_test datasets. The X_train dataframe has 7352 rows and 561 columns; the X_test dataframe has 2947 rows and 561 columns.

        2) A new column (1st) containing the subject identifiers is added to the X_train and X_test datasets, using column 2 of the subject_train and subject_test dataframes, respectively.

	3) The activity codes, contained in the y_test and y_train datasets is added as a new column in the the X_test and X_train datasets, respectively.

	4) Activity labels matching the activity codes are added as a new column to the X_test and X_train datasets.

        5) A column named “type” and listing "TRAIN" or "TEST" is added to the X_train and X_test datasets, respectively.  

	6) The X_train and X_test datasets are then merged using rbind().  The resulting dataframe has 10229 rows and 565 columns.

        7) A smaller dataframe is created by selecting specific variables which represent means and standard deviations (see CodeBook.md located in this repository for specific 	information).  The following 12 variables were selected in addition to the “subject”, “Activity” and “type” variables:

			tBodyAccMag-mean() 
			tBodyAccMag-std()  
			tGravityAccMag-mean()   
			tGravityAccMag-std()  
			tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()   
			tBodyAccJerkMag-std()    
			tBodyGyroMag-mean()   
			tBodyGyroMag-std()   
			tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()   
			tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()   
			fBodyAccMag-mean()   
			fBodyAccMag-std()   

        8) The mean of each one of the above 12 variables was calculated for each activity and each subject.  The final dataframe, containing the means of the 12 variables tabulated by activity and by subject, was written to the working directory as text file "result.txt" using write.table().
